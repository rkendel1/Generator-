# Prompt for generating tailored business ideas from GitHub trends
IDEA_PROMPT = RANDY_SKILLS_SUMMARY + """
Your mission: generate 3‚Äì4 extremely highly-tailored, non-obvious elevator pitches for how trending GitHub technologies could be applied to solve real-world problems.

Each idea must:
- Be *deeply aligned* with your unique background and skills
- Be either a:
  - "side_hustle" (small, quick-to-market)
  - "full_scale" (larger, more ambitious)
- Only include ideas you'd personally consider building or investing in
- Avoid generic SaaS dashboards, CRUD apps, marketplaces, or productivity clones

**CRITICAL CONSTRAINT:** Only generate ideas that leverage your specific background. If an idea doesn't match your experience, DO NOT include it. Every idea should feel custom-designed for your unique skill set.

**Quality filter:** Include only ideas with:
- Idea Score ‚â•8
- MVP Effort ‚â§4

If you can‚Äôt generate enough high-quality ideas, return fewer ‚Äî quality over quantity.

**Bias toward:** Unusual but fundable, high-leverage use cases with simple paths to traction. Think ‚Äúclever instead of big.‚Äù

Avoid:
- Boring SaaS or productivity tools
- Clone-like products
- Marketplaces or generic dashboards

Each pitch must follow this format exactly:

{
  "title": "Catchy name",
  "hook": "Open strong to get attention.",
  "value": "What does the solution actually do?",
  "evidence": "A brief insight or statistic to support credibility. Must reference actual studies or credible sources (include link).",
  "differentiator": "Why is this solution different or better?",
  "call_to_action": "What would you say to a decision-maker to move forward?",
  "type": "side_hustle OR full_scale",
  "score": 1‚Äì10,
  "mvp_effort": 1‚Äì10
}

Example:
[
  {
    "title": "AI-powered Museum Curation",
    "hook": "Imagine a museum where exhibits come alive...",
    "value": "RAGFlow can analyze historical documents...",
    "evidence": "According to a study by Pew Research Center...",
    "differentiator": "RAGFlow's deep document understanding...",
    "call_to_action": "Partner with us to revolutionize museum experiences...",
    "type": "side_hustle",
    "score": 8,
    "mvp_effort": 4
  }
]

# Prompt for generating investor-grade deep dives on selected ideas
DEEP_DIVE_PROMPT = RANDY_SKILLS_SUMMARY + """
You are a founder-operator and strategic investor combined ‚Äî part hacker, part realist. I'm giving you one idea from a previous brainstorm. Your task is to evaluate it rigorously as if you're preparing a startup pitch deck or internal investment memo.

Answer the following questions clearly and thoroughly. Be specific, data-backed where possible, and make judgments like a partner deciding whether to fund the business.

üöÄ Product Clarity & MVP
‚Ä¢ What is the Minimum Viable Product (MVP)? Focus on what proves core value quickly.
‚Ä¢ What's the fastest path to validating product-market fit? Include testable assumptions and traction signals.
‚Ä¢ What are the essential features to test core value? List features needed *only* for validation, not polish.
‚Ä¢ How would you implement the MVP (tech stack, workflow, setup)? Include rationale for each major decision.
‚Ä¢ Effort level: Time and skill estimate for MVP (scale: 1‚Äì10). Consider founder time, technical complexity, and dependencies.

üï∞ Timing / Why Now
‚Ä¢ Why is now the perfect time for this idea? Highlight urgency or unlocked opportunity.
‚Ä¢ What macro/tech/cultural shifts make this more viable than before? Name specific enablers (infrastructure, regulation, cost drops, etc.).

üìà Market Opportunity
‚Ä¢ Who is the target customer? Be precise ‚Äî segment by role, vertical, or behavior.
‚Ä¢ What pain point is being solved? Why is this pain urgent or expensive?
‚Ä¢ How big is the market (top-down or bottoms-up logic)? Estimate with real logic ‚Äî not hand-waving.
‚Ä¢ What is the monetization strategy (non-SaaS preferred)? Include how, when, and from whom revenue flows.
‚Ä¢ Time to profitability (rough estimate, months). Consider CAC, price point, and GTM model.

üß† Strategic Moat / IP / Differentiator
‚Ä¢ What's novel or hard to copy here? Could someone replicate it in 3 months?
‚Ä¢ Any defensible IP or network effect? Include process, data, or UX advantages.
‚Ä¢ Is there a strategic wedge to expand later? What‚Äôs the beachhead and follow-on?

üíº Business & Funding Snapshot
‚Ä¢ What's the ask if pitching an angel/seed investor? (amount, duration). Frame it in terms of milestone coverage.
‚Ä¢ What would you spend the first 6 months of funding on? Be tactical.
‚Ä¢ Who are the main competitors, and how is this better/different? Name names and compare strengths.
‚Ä¢ What is a realistic exit strategy? (acquisition targets, multiples, timing). Be grounded in comps.
‚Ä¢ Any traction channels or early adopters you'd pursue? Detail how you‚Äôd start getting real users.

üìä Investor Scoring Model  
Now score the idea across key dimensions investors care about (1‚Äì10):

{
  "Signal Score": {
    "Product-Market Fit Potential": 1‚Äì10,
    "Market Size & Timing": 1‚Äì10,
    "Founder's Ability to Execute": 1‚Äì10,
    "Technical Feasibility": 1‚Äì10,
    "Competitive Moat": 1‚Äì10,
    "Profitability Potential": 1‚Äì10,
    "Strategic Exit Potential": 1‚Äì10,
    "Overall Investor Attractiveness": 1‚Äì10
  }
}

Then give a final **Go / No-Go** rating and briefly summarize why.

‚úÖ Summary Slide  
Finish with a 1-paragraph executive summary an investor could copy/paste into an internal memo.
