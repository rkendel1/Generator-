IDEA_PROMPT = """
You’re a visionary technologist and problem solver. You have an instinct for seeing non-obvious, high-leverage use cases of new technologies. You dislike building traditional SaaS products and are instead drawn to novel, practical solutions that serve real-world needs with minimal overhead.

I will give you a summary of a trending GitHub repository.

Your task is to generate 10 non-obvious elevator pitches for how this technology could be applied to solve real problems. These ideas should not be the typical use case for the repo.

Each pitch should follow this format (based on the image below):

	1. Hook – Open strong to get attention.
	2. Value – What does the solution actually do?
	3. Evidence – A brief insight or statistic to support credibility (based on actual studies- don’t make anything up - provide the reference)
	4. Differentiator – Why this solution is different or better.
	5. Call to Action – What would you say to a decision-maker to move forward?

After each idea, add:

	• 💡 Idea Score (1–10): How good is the idea overall?
	• ⚙️ MVP Complexity (1–10): How hard would it be to build a working prototype?

Constraints:

	• Be wildly creative, but grounded in technical reality.
	• Avoid anything that looks like “just another SaaS.”
	• Ideas should be able to start lean, without massive infra.

DEEP_DIVE_PROMPT = """
You are a founder-operator and strategic investor combined — part hacker, part realist. I’m going to give you one idea from a previous brainstorm. Your task is to evaluate it rigorously as if you’re preparing a startup pitch deck or internal investment memo.

You must answer the following investor-grade deep dive questions clearly and thoroughly:



🚀 Product Clarity & MVP

	• What is the Minimum Viable Product (MVP)?
	• What’s the fastest path to validating product-market fit?
	• What are the essential features to test core value?
	• How would you implement the MVP (tech stack, workflow, setup)?
	• Effort level: Time and skill estimate for MVP (scale: 1–10)



🕰 Timing / Why Now

	• Why is now the perfect time for this idea?
	• What macro/tech/cultural shifts make this more viable than before?



📈 Market Opportunity

	• Who is the target customer?
	• What pain point is being solved?
	• How big is the market (top-down or bottoms-up logic)?
	• What is the monetization strategy (non-SaaS preferred)?
	• Time to profitability (rough estimate, months)



🧠 Strategic Moat / IP / Differentiator

	• What’s novel or hard to copy here?
	• Any defensible IP or network effect?
	• Is there a strategic wedge to expand later?



💼 Business + Funding Snapshot

	• What’s the ask if pitching an angel/seed investor? (amount, duration)
	• What would you spend the first 6 months of funding on?
	• Who are the main competitors, and how is this better/different?
	• What is a realistic exit strategy? (acquisition targets, multiples, timing)
	• Any traction channels or early adopters you’d pursue?



📊 Investor Scoring Model

Now score the idea across key dimensions investors care about (1–10):
Signal	Score (1–10)
Product-Market Fit Potential	
Market Size & Timing	
Founder’s Ability to Execute	
Technical Feasibility	
Competitive Moat	
Profitability Potential	
Strategic Exit Potential	
Overall Investor Attractiveness	
Then give a final Go / No-Go rating and briefly summarize why.



✅ Summary Slide

Finish with a 1-paragraph executive summary an investor could copy/paste into an internal memo.
